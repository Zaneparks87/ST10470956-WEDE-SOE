# Zaneparks Hyper Website
1. Project Overview

Zaneparks Hyper is a retail website developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website is designed to allow customers to explore products, learn about the store, make enquiries, contact the business, and use a demonstration order form.

 3. Technologies Used

The website uses the following technologies:
HTML5
HTML is used to create the structure and content of each webpage, including headings, navigation, forms, images, buttons, and sections.

 CSS3
CSS is used to control the appearance of the website, including colours, typography, spacing, layout, responsiveness, and interactive visual effects.

 Git and GitHub
Git and GitHub can be used to track changes, manage versions, and store the project repository.

 4. Website Pages

The website contains the following pages:

## 6. Main Features
 Navigation
The website provides navigation links to its main pages so users can move between the homepage, catalogue, About Us, order, contact, and enquiry sections.

Product Catalogue
The catalogue provides product information and interactive controls.
Features include:
- Product display.
- Product search.
- Price sorting from low to high.
- Price sorting from high to low.

Order Form
The order page includes:
- Customer information fields.
- Product selection.
- Delivery options.
- Input validation.
- Feedback messages.
The order form is a demonstration and does not process real payments unless a secure payment system has been separately implemented.

Contact Form
The contact page allows users to enter their details and a message. JavaScript validates the input and provides feedback.

 Enquiry Form
The enquiry page allows users to select an enquiry topic and enter their details and question.

The form includes:
- Required-field validation.
- Email validation.
- An optional order reference.
- A minimum message length.
- Success and error feedback.

FAQ Accordion
The FAQ section contains expandable questions. Users can click the plus sign to display an answer and click the minus sign to close it.

 Newsletter Form
The newsletter form checks the email address and provides feedback to the user.
Unless a mailing-list service has been connected, the form does not save email addresses or subscribe users to a real newsletter.

Interactive Map
A map can be displayed on the homepage using JavaScript and an embedded map. The map must be configured with the correct location and tested before the feature is considered complete.

7. JavaScript Files
The JavaScript files are organised in the `javascript` folder.

JavaScript file | Purpose 
catalogue.js > Handles catalogue interactions such as searching, sorting, and other implemented catalogue features.
order.js > Handles order form validation and delivery-option behaviour. 
contact.js > Validates the contact form and displays feedback. 
enquiry.js > Handles enquiry form validation and FAQ accordion interactions. 
newsletter.js > Validates newsletter form input and displays feedback. 
maps.js > Adds the embedded map if the map container and script are configured. 

Each HTML page should load only the JavaScript files it needs. Script paths and filenames must match the actual project structure.

8. Design and User Experience

The website uses a brown-and-cream colour scheme to maintain a consistent appearance across its pages.

The design aims to provide:
- Clear navigation.
- Readable text.
- Consistent spacing and layout.
- Clearly labelled forms.
- Helpful validation messages.
- Interactive buttons and FAQ controls.
- A layout that adapts to different screen sizes.

The website should be tested on desktop and mobile screen sizes to ensure that the content remains readable and usable.

9. SEO and Accessibility

Search engine optimisation and accessibility should be considered throughout the project.

SEO checks include:
- Meaningful page titles.
- Relevant meta descriptions.
- Appropriate headings.
- Descriptive internal links.
- Relevant image alternative text.
- Optimised image sizes.
- Correct page and asset paths.

Accessibility checks include:
- Labels associated with form controls.
- Useful alternative text for meaningful images.
- Keyboard-accessible buttons and interactive controls.
- Visible keyboard focus indicators.
- Appropriate colour contrast.
- Clear error and success messages.
- Correct heading structure.

10. How to Run the Website

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

1. Download or clone the project repository.
2. Open the `ZaneparksHyper` folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. Confirm that the HTML files, `styles.css`, `javascript` folder, and `assets` folder are present.
4. Open `index.html` in a web browser, or use the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code.
5. Navigate through the website using the navigation links.
6. Test the interactive features and forms.
7. Check the browser developer console for JavaScript errors.

11. Testing

The website should be tested before submission.

Testing should include:

- Opening every webpage.
- Checking all navigation links.
- Confirming that product images load.
- Searching for products.
- Testing both price-sorting options.
- Opening and closing every FAQ item.
- Submitting forms with empty fields.
- Testing invalid email addresses.
- Submitting forms with valid information.
- Checking order delivery options.
- Confirming that feedback messages appear correctly.
- Testing the website on desktop and mobile screen sizes.
- Checking the browser console for errors.
- Confirming that CSS and JavaScript files load correctly.

12. Forms and Current Limitations

The website uses JavaScript for client-side form validation and feedback.

Client-side validation helps users identify missing or incorrectly entered information. However, it does not automatically send data to a server.

Unless a backend or form-handling service has been connected and tested:

- The enquiry form does not send messages to the store.
- The contact form does not send messages to the store.
- The newsletter form does not save subscribers.
- The order form does not create a real order or process payment.
13. Future Improvements

Possible future improvements include:

- Connecting enquiry and contact forms to a backend.
- Implementing AJAX form submission if required.
- Adding secure order processing and payment integration if needed.
- Connecting the newsletter form to a mailing-list service.
- Confirming and improving mobile navigation.
- Adding a product gallery lightbox if required.
- Improving image compression and page performance.
- Adding and testing `robots.txt` and `sitemap.xml` if required.
- Testing and improving accessibility.
- Deploying the website and testing the live version.

## 14. Documentation

The project includes the following documentation files:

- `README.md` — describes the project, structure, features, setup, and limitations.
- `CHANGELOG.md` — records project changes, fixes, and improvements.
